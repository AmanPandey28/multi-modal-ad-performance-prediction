# multi-modal-ad-performance-prediction
A PyTorch-based multi-modal system to predict ad performance (e.g., CTR) by analyzing image and text content from (simulated) ad creatives. Demonstrates CV and NLP fusion for monetization tasks.

Overview: Explain the goal (predicting ad CTR/performance from visual and textual content), its importance for monetization, and explicitly state that performance data (CTR) is simulated due to the unavailability of public datasets, and the project focuses on demonstrating the multi-modal architecture and pipeline.

Features/Key Aspects:

Multi-modal deep learning approach (CV + NLP).

Visual feature extraction (e.g., EfficientNet via Timm).

Textual feature extraction (e.g., Sentence-BERT via Hugging Face Transformers).

Early fusion (concatenation) of features.

Regression model for performance prediction.

Dataset:

Clearly describe how the dummy data was generated (random images with some text, simulated CTR with simple rules).

State that the image generation script is within the main project notebook.

Explain that for real-world application, this section would detail the actual dataset used.

Methodology: Briefly outline the steps: image processing, text tokenization, feature extraction from pre-trained models, feature fusion, and the architecture of the final predictive model.

Results/Evaluation:

Present your MSE, RMSE, MAE results on the simulated test data.

Include the scatter plot of True vs. Predicted CTR.

Discuss that while metrics are based on simulated data, they validate the pipeline's functionality. Emphasize what was learned about building such a system.

Setup/Installation:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Mention Python version (e.g., 3.8+).

Note about internet connection for downloading pre-trained models from Timm/Hugging Face on first run.

Usage/How to Run:

"Open Multi_Modal_Ad_Analysis_Complete.ipynb in JupyterLab/Notebook and run cells sequentially. The notebook includes dummy data generation."
